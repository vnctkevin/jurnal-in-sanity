# A Next.js Blog with a Native Authoring Experience as well as Cloudinary Image Gallery<!-- omit in toc -->

This blog is a statically generated blog that uses [Next-js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) for the frontend and [Sanity](sanity-homepage) to handle its blog content as well as [Cloudinary](cloudinary) image gallery. It comes with a native Sanity Studio that offers features like real-time collaboration, instant side-by-side content previews, and intuitive editing. 

The project is based on the [Next.js Blog with a Native Authoring Experience](https://github.com/sanity-io/nextjs-blog-cms-sanity-v3) and the [Next.js & Cloudinary example app](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-cloudinary). The project is currently deployed in [Vercel](vercel).
